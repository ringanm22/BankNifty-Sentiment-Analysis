In the contemporary era, predicting stock markets holds immense significance, given their sensitivity to current events. This study proposes a forecasting model aimed at predicting sentiment encompassing Bank-Nifty stock prices. By associating emotions with market dynamics, the research explores the connection between news-projected sentiment and actual stock prices, thus scrutinizing the efficient market theory. Anticipating future stock trends proves challenging due to the multitude of influencing factors. Notably, news content holds potential to alter market trajectories. Hence, the investigation delves into this correlation to ascertain if news articles and historical prices can foresee stock movements. Employing a pretrained FinBert model for sentiment analysis and a LSTM for stock price prediction, the study seeks to unravel this intricate linkage.
